first_article_description: This system is a Web-based Digital Fare Calculator
  System developed to help users estimate transportation fares, travel times,
  and other relevant travel details. Specifically designed for the
  Silangan-Cubao (AFPHODA) Jeepney Line, the system aims to provide accurate
  fare estimates for commuters traveling along this route. It is intended to
  streamline the fare calculation process, offering a user-friendly interface
  that can quickly generate the expected costs and travel times based on input
  parameters such as start and end points. The development of this system aligns
  with the academic requirements of STI-SHS03, and serves as a practical project
  for the courses Computer Programming 4, Computer Programming 5, Practical
  Research 2, and English for Academic and Professional Purposes. It combines
  theoretical learning with real-world application, ensuring that students apply
  their programming, research, and communication skills in creating a functional
  and practical tool that meets both academic and user needs.
