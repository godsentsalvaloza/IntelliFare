first_article_name: About IntelliFare

first_article_description: This system is a web-based digital fare calculator developed to help users estimate transportation fares, travel times, and other relevant travel details. Specifically designed for the Silangan-Cubao (AFPHODA) Jeepney Line, the system aims to provide accurate fare estimates for commuters traveling along this route. It is intended to streamline the fare calculation process, offering a user-friendly interface that can quickly generate the expected costs and travel times based on input parameters such as start and end points. The development of this system aligns with the academic requirements of STI-SHS03, and serves as a practical project for the courses Computer Programming 4, Computer Programming 5, Practical Research 2, and English for Academic and Professional Purposes. It combines theoretical learning with real-world application, ensuring that students apply their programming, research, and communication skills in creating a functional and practical tool that meets both academic and user needs.
